# 🦆 Duck Shooter

A chaotic experiment from an old university assignment — what happens when you try to slap **Balatro-style roguelike elements** onto a duck shooting game? Absolute quackery.

## 🎯 About

This game was originally created as part of a coursework assignment using [GDevelop](https://gdevelop.io/). The goal? Build a simple shooter. The result? A weird little prototype that started mutating into something *way* more interesting.

- 🧠 Power-up mechanics with a roguelike twist  
- 🎰 Random modifiers inspired by *Balatro*  
- 🦆 Ducks.
